    <!-- 
    This program creates an A-Frame scene with a grid and three lines, one for each axis. 
    The grid is created using a plane geometry and a metal material to give it a shiny appearance. 
    The x, y, and z axis lines are created using line geometry and are positioned along their respective axes. 
    The line__2 attribute specifies the start and end points of each line.

    When you load the page, you should see a grid with the x, y, and z axis lines plotted across it. 
    The x-axis is represented by a red line, the y-axis by a green line, and the z-axis by a blue line.
